**Last Updated: December 27, 2025**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Orbit VPN ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application and VPN service (collectively, the "Service").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our VPN service is designed with a strict zero-log policy, meaning we do not track, collect, or store your online activity.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Information You Provide

**Account Information**: We do not require you to create an account with personal information. All subscriptions are handled through Apple's App Store, and we do not have access to your payment information.

### 2. Automatically Collected Information

**Device Information**: We may collect basic device information such as:
- Device type and model

- Data usage amounts (total bandwidth used)
- Connection success/failure rates

**Crash and Diagnostic Data**: We use Apple's built-in crash reporting to identify and fix technical issues.
